### Objective:

IBM Data Science Capstone Project to predict the success of future SpaceX launches in an attempt to capture the benefit of the reusable rocket technology.


### Background:
This project predicts if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises the Falcon 9 rocket launches with a cost of $62MM whereas other providers cost upwards to $165MM. If it can be determined that the first stage will land successfully, then the cost of the launch can be determined. This information can be used to keep SpaceX competitive for rocket launches.


### Deliverables:
All work is captured in Jupyter Notebooks. The primary deliverable is the final report presentation: "SpaceX_Capstone."


### Hightlighted Skills:

* Compiling a complete dataset using pandas manipulation, web scrapping, and SQL querying.

* EDA techniques for brief insights.

* Interactive dashboards using plotly & dash for in-depth analysis.

* Model building using various machine learning techniques
